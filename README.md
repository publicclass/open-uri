# Asynchronous Open URI

  A CommonJS module inspired by Rubys Open-URI library.


## Install

  It's available on npm, so a simple `npm install open-uri` should be enough.


## Usage

	var open = require("open-uri");

	// Get a website
	open("http://google.com",function(err,google){console.log(google)})

	// Get a file
	open("/var/log/system.log",function(err,log){console.log(log)})

	// Stream a file to STDOUT
	open("file:///var/log/system.log",process.stdout)

	// Stream a website to a file
	var file = require("fs").createWriteStream("/tmp/goog.html")
	open("https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=open+uri",file)

	// Chain it 
	open("http://google.com",console.log)("http://publicclass.se",process.stdout)

	// Get a file off of an FTP
	open("ftp://user:pass@ftp.example.com/myfile.txt",function(err,txt){console.log(txt)})


## Supported schemes

  http, https, file & ftp

Uses the [addressable module](https://github.com/publicclass/addressable) for parsing the scheme and the [mime module](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime) for parsing the data.


### Options for all schemes

* `buffer`    (boolean) For when you only want the body to be buffered and returned as the second argument instead of receiving the direct stream. Defaults to `true`.


### Options for HTTP(S)

* `follow`    (boolean)   Follow redirects. Defaults to `true`.
* `gzip`      (boolean)   If the request should be attempted with gzip. Defaults to `true`.
* `headers`   (object)    Headers to pass along with the HTTP request.
* `method`    (string)    HTTP request method. Default 'GET'.
* `body`      (readablestream|string|buffer) A body of data to pass with the request.
* `key`       (string)    (HTTPS Only) Private key to use for SSL. Defaults to ENV var `NODE_HTTPS_KEY` or attempts to find it as "./key.pem".
* `cert`      (string)    (HTTPS Only) Public x509 certificate to use. Defaults to ENV var NODE_HTTPS_CERT or attempts to find it as "./cert.pem".
* `ca`        (string|array) (HTTPS Only) An authority certificate or array of authority certificates to check the remote host against.

### Options for file

* `encoding`  (string) The encoding of the file to read.


### Options for FTP

* `anonymous` (boolean) If no user info is in the URI, add anonymous. Defaults to `true`.



## History

### 0.4.1

* [Fix] Added `buffer`-option to file and ftp schemes.
* [Change] Updated mime dependency to 1.2.5.

### 0.4.0

* [Change] Added the `buffer` option, which is an inverted `stream`, which is now deprecated. 
* [Fix] Avoid a global variable (by [senorpedro](https://github.com/senorpedro/))
* [Fix] _HTTP_/_HTTPS_ Only 301, 302 and 307 is proper statusCodes for redirects.

### 0.3.5

* [Fix] Use Buffer.byteLength(body) only on strings, and body.length on Buffers.
* [Fix] Support for broken redirect implementations that give relative Location: headers.

### 0.3.4

* [Fix] Use Buffer.byteLength(body) for Content-Length header as well, it's just better (and fixes a bug where the body was cut off).

### 0.3.3

* [Fix] Avoid 'Out of bounds'-errors by using Buffer.byteLength(chunk) instead of chunk.length.

### 0.3.2

* [Fix] Errors was being thrown when using userinfo in HTTP uris.

### 0.3.1

* [Fix] Updated `addressable` dependency to 0.3.3. Now both addressable.URI and Nodes built-in URL objects are valid as the `uri` argument.
* [Fix] Fixed error thrown when an error occurs in utils.buffer().

### 0.3.0

* [Feature] Updated `addressable` dependency to 0.3.1.

* [Feature] _HTTPS_ Added key and certificate parsing.

* [Feature] _HTTP_/_HTTPS_ Added a `method` option can be used if anything other than GET is desired.

* [Feature] _HTTP_/_HTTPS_ Added a `body` options for passing a payload with the request. Can be either a ReadableStream, a String or a Buffer.

### 0.2.2

* [Feature] Re-factored the schemes into separate files. Now adding more schemes will be much easier.

* [Feature] Added a simple binary. Usage: `open-uri http://google.com`

* [Fix] _FTP_ is now closing properly when completed or failed.

### 0.2.1

* [Feature] Better parsing of content using the [mime module](https://github.com/bentomas/node-mime) for Content-Type lookup.

* [Feature] _FTP_ Initial support using the [node-ftp module](https://github.com/mscdex/node-ftp).


### 0.2.0

* [Feature] _HTTP(S)_ Now supports gzip responses (and adds a 'Accept-Encoding: gzip'-header if there is none already).

* [Feature] _HTTP(S)_ Now decodes JSON if response is of 'Content-Type: application/json'.

* [Fix] _HTTP(S)_ Fixed an issue with redirects.


### 0.1.0

* Initial version.


## TODO

*  _HTTP(S)_ Support older versions of Node? Currently only support 0.3.6 and up (because of the new HTTP Client API).

*  _HTTP(S)_ Proxy support.

*  _FTP_ Listing files (when uri.pathname ends with "/")

*  _FTP_ Uploading files (when opts.body is passed)

* A timeout option for all schemes would be useful.

* A binary, just for fun really. Usage: `open-uri http://google.com`. 
  - Output to process.stdout by default. 
  - Allow a REST interface? So if something is written to stdin it's sent as body to the url using POST by default, but definable with -X (curl style!)
  - Pass command line arguments as options to the scheme functions. Ex. `open-uri -gzip http://google.com` sets opts.gzip to true.

* More schemes support? Suggestions?
  - Support for opening a file descriptor? Basically a shortcut for fs.readFile(fd).
  - S3 (using [knox module](https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox)), should list objects when path ends with "/"
  - NNTP (using [node-nntp module](https://github.com/mscdex/node-nntp))
  - IRC (using [node-irc module](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc)), open("irc://bot@chat.freenode.net/nodejs") -> callback for each message? with a say function in the callback? ex: `function(err,from,to,msg,say){ if( to == "bot" && ~msg.indexOf("hello") ){ say(from+": HI!") } }` `this` could be the irc object so the socket can be closed...
  - SQL query. Is there a standard URI for this? Something like: `mysql://root@localhost/mydb?query=SELECT * FROM x;` or `sqlite3://file.sqlite?query=SELECT * FROM x;` possibly with support for input escaping. open("sqlite3://file.sqlite?query=SELECT * FROM x WHERE id=? AND name=?;",[12,"bob"]) using the drivers own escaping. With a callback like `function(err,rows,meta){}`.
